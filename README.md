# Beaver Guide

A Go package for programmatically working with the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) course guide (unofficial API).

The `MrSaints/BeaverGuide` project is NEITHER AFFILIATED WITH NOR ENDORSED BY the LSE university and/or its student union (LSE SU). 
It is a personal project which exposes a rudimentary API for accessing and manipulating [publicly available course information](http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/Default.htm).
