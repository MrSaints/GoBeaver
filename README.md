# LSE Courses

A Go package for programmatically working with LSE course guide (unofficial API).

The `MrSaints/LSECourses` project is NEITHER AFFILIATED with the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) nor its student union (LSE SU). 
It is a personal project which exposes a rudimentary API for accessing and manipulating [publicly available course information](http://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar/Default.htm). 
Please use this library at your own discretion.
